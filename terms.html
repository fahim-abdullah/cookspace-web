                        In the event of unavailability of certain ingredients, we will replace with similar ingredients while preserving the quality of the meals without update. While we attempt to identify ingredients that may cause allergic reactions for those with food allergies, we however do not make representation on the same and there is always a risk of contamination.

We reserve the right to issue such full and partial refunds and any additional compensation in respect of the affected part of the Item, and also in respect of delivery if the whole order was affected, unless we have reasonable cause to believe that the problem was caused after delivery. We may request a photograph or other documentation showing the problem if it is something that can be seen by inspecting the Items. Prior to processing your refund or account credit, we may take into account relevant factors including the details of the order, including your account history, what happened on delivery and other information.

                        Please refer to our delivery information page for the delivery area covered and we may engage third party service provider to ensure delivery of the order within the time slot selected. Whilst we aim to ensure the service level of such third party service provider, we are not able to warrant their conduct or behavior and shall not be held responsible for any omissions or misconduct caused by such third party service provider.
                        <br><br>
                        Your order will be delivered at the timeslot selected and we endeavor to meet the said delivery time slot however it may be occasionally delayed due to traffic flow, weather conditions, unforeseen incidences or force majeure event, and we shall not be held liable for failure to deliver.
                        <br><br>
                        If it is in our view that the delivery of your order is likely to be substantially delayed, we will contact you to arrange an alternative delivery timeframe. If that timeframe is unacceptable to you, you may decline to accept the order and we will: (i) if cash payment is to be made upon delivery, not charge you for the order; or (ii) if online payment has been made, refund you the cost of such order to your bank account. The processing of the refund may take up to seven (7) working days.

                        <br><br>
